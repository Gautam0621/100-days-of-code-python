# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 01: June 5, 2023 (Print)

**Today's Progress**: Print, String manipulations, debugging, Input 
Function, Band name generator

**Thoughts**: Started day 01 with all the enthusiasm to learn new things in 
Python. Although it's very basic print statements, it's nice to brushup things.
Way to go 100DaysOfCode!!!
